## Warmup

1. You are a data scientist at an advertisement company and you are
   interested if the new campaign is boosting sales relative to the
   previous campaign. Describe the steps required to establish that
   the new campaign **causes** sales to go up or down.

2. What is a p-value and statistical power? What is the relationship
   between the two. Feel free to look up if you need to.

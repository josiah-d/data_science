## Warmup: Probability Practice

1. Let's say we play a game where I keep flipping a coin until I get heads.
   If the first time I get heads is on the nth coin, then I pay you 2n-1 dollars.
   How much would you pay me to play this game for us to break even in the
   long term? Show your work.

2. Write a program to simulate the game and verify that your answer is correct.

    "### Part 1: Make sure your Docker PostgreSQL server is running\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't done so yet, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/GalvanizeDataScience/docker/blob/master/reference/docker_postgres.md) to start the Docker container that contains PostgreSQL and a sample database called readychef with data from an internet-based meal service. It is [normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization), which is a way of ensuring that data is stored no more than once in a database. This avoids inconsistency and saves space. \n",
    "\n",
    "The readychef database has five tables: events, meals, referrals, users, and visits. The events table contains actions users have done at the site (bought, liked, or shared meals). It has four fields: the event (bought, share or like), the date, the user id, and the meal id.\n",
    "\n",
    "The meals table contains the meal id, the type (which can be Chinese, French, etc.), the date, and the price. The users table contains the user id, the date, and the campaign id (which appears to be a two-letter abbreviation for the social media site that the user was acquired on). The referrals table contains pairs of user ids: the user who was referred and the user that referred them. Finally, the visits table contains dates and user ids representing user visits to the readychef site; a given user may have many visits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is normalized, the events table has ids for both users and meals, but in order to get the price of the meal, we have to look up that meal using its id in the meal table. By storing the price in a separate table rather than with each event, the schema enforces the rule that a given meal always costs the same amount (while saving save as a bonus). A normalized database design allows us to use _only_ the meal's ID to refer to the meal _anywhere_ it may appear, but does mean that to get meal details we almost always have to join together two tables. *As a data scientist, you will frequently write SQL queries gathering data from various tables.*"

    "### Part 2: Connect to the Database\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment we recommend using DBeaver, a GUI tool, to access the PostgreSQL database. Use DBeaver to connect to the readychef database by creating a connection to PostgreSQL, following [these instructions](dbeaver_connection.md). Use \"readychef\" as the database name in the connection (the default is \"postgres\"). The tables in this database (remember, an SQL database typically contains multiple tables) can then be viewed under the connection under \"Schemas ... public ... Tables\" by expanding the icon for the readychef database in the left column of DBeaver.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to access PostgreSQL databases through Python using a module called psycopg2. Directions to do that are at the end of this assignment and will be covered in the afternoon. We encourage you to try that way of connecting when you come back to this assignment in the future."

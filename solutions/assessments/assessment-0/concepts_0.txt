Sample mean

    While it may seem strange to take the average of coin flips, when 
    the flip outcomes (heads or tails) are encoded as 1's and 0's, 
    respectively, it is of course perfectly legitimate to take the 
    average of coin flipping outcomes.  Further, this has the 
    particularly useful benefit that it captures the proportion of 
    flips that are heads (encoded as 1's). Since 1's and 0's are just 
    numbers like any other, we simply take the mean of these numbers 
    just as we would any other set of numbers. I.e., here:

    ((1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0) / 5) = 0.6


Probability of data given fair coin

    # Solving the "S = {1,1,0,1,0}" problem:

    The probability of this sequence of head flips (assuming a fair 
    coin) is the same as *any other* sequence of head flips, i.e., 
    (0.5)^5.

    # Solving the "3 heads" problem:

    The probability of seeing 3 heads in 5 flips (assuming a fair 
    coin), (as opposed to the sequence "S = {1,1,0,1,0}"), i.e., 
    Pr(3 heads in 5 flips), is determined by a binomial probability 
    model with n = 5 and p = 0.5. This model gives us the following 
    formula for the probability:

    5c3 * 0.5^3 * 0.5^2 = 0.3125

    5c3 is five choose three and it is equal to 5!/(3!*2!).  It is the 
    number of ways we could get 3 heads on five flips. E.g., HHHTT or 
    HTHTH, etc. And of course, the probability of a head or a tail on 
    any given flip is the same at 0.5, which shows how the binomial 
    probability distribution probabilities are produced.
